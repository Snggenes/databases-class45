1-
The columns which consist of more than one value violate 1NF rule.
In this case food_code column and food_description column violates the 1NF rule.
One way to solve taht problem is to create new table associated with required columns in this table.

2-
Rather then extracting , we should create other tables for example,
we should have an apart table only for venue info,
and the exact thing for food info.

3-
3NF rule builds on the concepts of 1NF and 2NF and additionally
non-prime attributes must depend on the primary key directly.
To manage that first we must have everthing done as mantioned about in the
answers of 1-2. And then we must calrify which columns are primary keys,
for example member_id, member_name and member_address should be in an apart table
and member_id should be our primary key that links with other tables.
We should have 3 other tables for dinner, venue, and food.
Dinner_id, venue_code and food_code should be our primary keys that should be linked
to member_id for example.
